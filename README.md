Spock Testing Workshop
======================
Workshop for testing Java projects with [Spock] and [Groovy].

Project Setup with Maven
------------------------
In order to get [Spock] into our Maven project, we need to do the following in our [pom.xml].

1. Add Groovy as a (test) dependency (see [pom.xml](pom.xml#L27-L32)).
2. Add Spock dependency (see [pom.xml](pom.xml#L34-L39)).
3. Add compiler configuration for Groovy since Mavenâ€™s default only compiles Java (see [pom.xml](pom.xml#L94-L120)).
4. Make Maven aware of `/src/test/groovy` being a test source directory since Mavenâ€™s default is `/src/test/java` (see [pom.xml](pom.xml#L76-L77)).
5. Make Maven Surefire plugin aware of files ending with `*Spec` are test class files since Surefireâ€™s default is `*Test` (see [pom.xml](pom.xml#L122-L133)).
6. Add CGLib and Objenesis in order to be able to Mock classes (see [pom.xml](pom.xml#L41-L57)).

Part 1: Blocks, Expectations and Pending Features
-------------------------------------------------
Read the [Spock Primer section] of the [Spock Framework Reference Documentation] to learn about the basic [Spock] terminology, fixture and feature methods, blocks and expectations.

Note that in contrast to the [Spock Primer][Spock Primer section], I prefer using `given` instead of `setup` for I like my test to be as close to natural language as possible and `setup` does not sound very natural to me.

Also I don't like block comments to stay in the test after it has been implemented (as suggested in the [Specifications as Documentation section]) for I want the *code* to be self-explanatory.

Then try to do the following objectives:
- [x] The method `isOfAge` method in [User] is not implemented properly yet. However there is a test in [UserClassSpec] which is annotated with `@PendingFeature`. Change `isOfAge`, in order to make the test's expectation be true. Once you did, remove the annotation.<br/>
  Don't implement the method, just make the test's expectation true doing the very least necessary.
- [x] The feature methods uses `given`, `when` and `then`. Try to make it shorter using an `expect` block.
- [x] Our current implementation of [User] allows to create users who were not born yet. Write a `@PendingFeature` that expects that `"creating a user with a future birthday throws an IllegalArgumentExpecption"`.
- [x] Adjust [User] to make the feature no longer pending and remove the annotation.
- [x] Write another feature method that specifies that `"no exception in thrown if the birthday is in the past"`.

Part 2: Data Driven Testing
---------------------------
Read the [Data Driven Testing section] of the [Spock Framework Reference Documentation] to learn about `where` blocks and their data table and pipe notations and the `@Unroll` annotation.

Then try to do the following objectives:
- [x] If you did the very least necessary in part 1, the implementation of `isOfAge` is not really how its name suggests because not only users are of age whose 18th birthday is today! Write another feature method to ensure that `"isOfAge should return true if the user's birthday is more than 18 years ago"`. Use a `where` block to test several cases.
- [x] Add an `@Unroll` annotation to get more information about which cases have succeeded and which did not.
- [x] Add another data driven test to test negative cases.
- [x] Review your features and try to make more test data driven.

Part 3: Mocking and Stubbing
----------------------------
Read the [Interaction Based Testing section] of the [Spock Framework Reference Documentation] to learn about Mocks, Stubs and Spies.

Then try to do the following objectives:
- [x] We want to write a test for the [UserService] which ensures that `"registerUser persists the user data via UserRepository"`. Use a Mock for the [UserRepository] since we don't want to test it here (and there is no implantation ðŸ˜‰). Feel free to use a Mock for the [User] object as well.
- [x] We want to avoid registering users which are already registered. Write another feature method that ensures that `"registerUser does not persist user data if the user name was registered before"`. Make your test succeed, ensuring that all others still don't fail. Also we might want to throw an exception in that case.
